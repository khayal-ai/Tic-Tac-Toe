# Tic-Tac-Toe

An unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game implemented using the **Minimax algorithm**.

This project allows a human player to play against an AI that always makes the optimal move, meaning the AI will never lose and the user cannot beat it.

---

## How It Works
- The game logic is implemented in `tictactoe.py`
- The graphical interface is implemented in `runner.py`
- The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to evaluate all possible game states and choose the best move
